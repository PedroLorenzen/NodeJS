                    Server-side rendering (SSR) in Node.js is a technique that generates HTML on the server and sends it
                    to the client's browser,
                    providing a fully rendered page on the initial load. This approach is useful for improving the
                    performance and
                    SEO of web applications.
                </p>
                <p class="infoParagraph">
                    Unlike client-side rendering (this is the standard if nothing is specified), where the browser
                    downloads JavaScript files and then builds the page, SSR executes
                    the logic of application on the server, creating the HTML of the page and sending it directly to the
                    browser.

                    In our previous project we loaded pages from the filesystem and passed it through a templating
                    engine (readPage and renderPage
                    functions). This process injected dynamic content, like custom titles and CSS links, into the pages.
                    Our templating engine
                    read HTML files, incorporated global components like headers and footers, and allowed for dynamic
                    placeholders to be filled in.
                    Then we had express routes configured to serve the dynamically prepared HTML
                    content directly, bypassing the need for static file serving for these pages.

                <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                    In this project I am using SSR and loading pages from the filesystem and passing it through a
                    templating engine:
                    <i>export function readPage (path) {<br />
                        return fs.readFileSync(path).toString()<br />
                        }<br /></i>
                    <i>export function renderPage (page, config = {}) {<br />
                        const header = fs.readFileSync('./public/components/header/header.html').toString()<br />
                        const footer = fs.readFileSync('./public/components/footer/footer.html').toString()<br />
                        const menu = fs.readFileSync('./public/components/menu/menu.html').toString()<br />
                        return header + page + menu + footer<br />
                        }<br /></i>
                    Then I am using readPage and renderPage in my routes to serve the dynamically prepared HTML content
                    directly,
                    bypassing the need for static file serving for these pages: <br />
                    <i>const home = readPage('./public/pages/home.html')<br />
                        export const homePage = renderPage(home)<br /></i>
                    Finally I am using the routes as specified in the express server - look at the picture on the right
                    ->

                <p class="infoParagraph">
                    Client side rendering is on the other hand the standard way of rendering pages in a web application.
                    The browser downloads the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and then builds the page in the browser.
                </p>
                <p class="infoParagraph">
                    CSR can be useful for web applications that are highly interactive, because it allows for faster
                    page loads and a more dynamic user experience.
                    However, it can also lead to reduced SEO performance and loading the entire page in the browser can
                    be slower than rendering it on the server.
                    This is because search engines have a harder time indexing client-side rendered pages,
                    because CSR rely on JavaScript to build the page content in the webbrowser and is not sent as a
                    fully rendered page from the server.
                </p>
                <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                    CSR don't need a server to render the page, therefore it doesn't need to use a templating engine to
                    inject dynamic content into the page.
                    So in the end choosing between SSR and CSR depends on the specific requirements of the application.
                    If the requirements are better SEO performance and faster initial page loads, SSR is the way to go.
                    If the applications needs to be highly interactive and dont need to depend on a server or SEO, CSR
                    is the way to go.
