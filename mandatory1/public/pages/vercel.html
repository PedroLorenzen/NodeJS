                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Vercel is a very easy to use platform for deploying webapplications and static websites. 
                        It can both work with node projects and static sites, and it is very easy to deploy a project to Vercel.
                        Vercel has nice featues to analyze the performance of the site and to monitor the deployment process while also providing a nice overview of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        The good thing about Vercel is that it handles installation of node modules and dependencies for me, so I can focus on the frontend part of the project.
                        If i'm not using node, it will still deploy the project as a static site.
                        It renders the css and javascript files and serves the html files to the client. This is a great way to deploy a project, as it is very easy to use.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        When deploying a project to Vercel, I need to install the package using <i> npm install -g vercel<br /> </i>
                        Afterwards I need to login to my vercel account: <i> vercel login<br /> </i>
                        When I have logged in I can start the deployment process by running: <i> vercel<br /> </i>
                        Here I have to specify the project folder and the settings for the deployment. These settings are stored in a vercel.json file.
                        <i>vercel.json</i> has details about the build settings, routes, and other settings for the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        After the project is deployed, I can see the deployment process in the Vercel dashboard, where I can see the performance of the site and monitor the deployment process.
                        I also have to opportunity to connect the project to my github repository, so that the project is automatically deployed when I push changes to the repository.
                        It can essentially handle the CI/CD for me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        In the dashboard I can follow a link to the deployed project and see the site live. This is a great way to deploy a project, as it is very easy to use.
                        I just copy the vercel link and send it to anyone who wants to see the project.
