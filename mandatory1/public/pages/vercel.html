                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Vercel is a very easy to use platform for deploying the frontend part of web applications. 
                        It is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions that enables me to host my projects with ease.
                        Vercel has nice featues to analyze the performance of the site and to monitor the deployment process while also providing a nice overview of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        The cool thing about Vercel is that it handles all the server-side rendering for me, so I can focus on the frontend part of the project.
                        It renders the css and javascript files and serves the html files to the client. This is a great way to deploy a project, as it is very easy to use.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        When deploying a project to Vercel, I need to install the package usin <i> npm install -g vercel </i> and then run <i> vercel login </i> to log in to my account.
                        Afterwards I can run <i> vercel </i> in the project folder to deploy and configure the project where the settings are stored in a vercel.json file.
                        This file is used to configure the deployment settings for the project. It has details about the build settings, routes, and other settings for the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        After the project is deployed, I can see the deployment process in the Vercel dashboard, where I can see the performance of the site and monitor the deployment process.
                        I also have to opportunity to connect the project to my github repository, so that the project is automatically deployed when I push changes to the repository.
                        It can essentially handle the CI/CD for me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        In the dashboard I can follow a link to the deployed project and see the site live. This is a great way to deploy a project, as it is very easy to use.
                        I just copy the vercel link and send it to anyone who wants to see the project.
