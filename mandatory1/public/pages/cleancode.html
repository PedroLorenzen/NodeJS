                        When using console.log you can easily and quickly make checkpoints your code that gives you information about what your code
                        returns, executes or prints. It's a good way to debug your code and see what's happening in your code. It's a fundamental
                        method for dynamic logging. It can though make log pollution if not handled correctly and affect performance.

                        ESLint is a tool that automatically analyses your codebase and identifies errors in your syntax and logic before runtime. It
                        has automatic refactoring that can fix the issues it finds, even though it then will change the code or confuse you. 
                        I use it to scan my code and give me feedback on how to improve my code.

                        It helps me to understand where the code is failing and why.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Promises in JavaScript makes using asynchronous code easier to read and write. When using async and await it allows for a more
                        intuitive flow of execution. This syntactic sugar lets you pause your code while waiting for a Promise to settle without
                        blocking the execution of the code. Even though Javascript is single-threaded it manages tasks efficiently thanks to its event
                        loop deciding the execution sequence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        Putting async before a function means you're going to use await in the function, which waits for a Promise to settle (either
                        complete or fail) before continuing execution. This makes my code much cleaner and saves me from falling into the dreaded
                        Callback Hell or Pyramid of Doom where i'd have a lot of callbacks nested inside callbacks, making everything harder to read
                        and debug.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Arrow functions provide a concise syntax and lexically bind this, making code cleaner, especially in callbacks and functions
                        where this refers to the surrounding context, not the function itself. This eliminates common errors related to this in
                        traditional functions, enhancing readability and reducing boilerplate in scenarios like array operations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        Traditional functions are valuable for object methods and complex functions due to their ability to access the dynamic this
                        context and their suitability for constructors. Their flexibility in handling this, the arguments object, and function
                        hoisting makes them better suited where context and functionality is important.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Coding standards are crucial for maintaining clean code, serving as a blueprint for developers to follow, ensuring
                        consistency, readability, and maintainability across a project. They minimize cognitive load by providing clear guidelines on
                        naming conventions, file organization, formatting, and best practices, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather
                        than deciphering code.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Adhering to these standards facilitates smoother collaboration within teams, as code written by one developer is easily
                        understood by others, streamlining the review process and reducing the likelihood of errors.{' '}
