                        Styling with CSS is a common and popular way to style a website.
                        CSS basically communicates with the HTML through selectors and properties.
                        These selectors can be classes, ids, or elements, and the properties are the styles that are applied to the selectors.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        When I style with CSS, firstly I have to make sure the CSS file is linked to the HTML file. 
                        I can do this by adding a link tag in the head of the HTML file.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        One of the drawbacks of CSS is that it can be hard to maintain and scale, especially in larger projects.
                        Also the fine details and time it takes to style a website can be time consuming.
                        It is a common problem that it can be difficult to maintain a consistent look and feel across the website using vanilla CSS.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Styling with tailwind is a new way to style a website. It is a utility-first CSS framework that is easy to use and maintain.
                        It has a lot of prebuilt utility classes that can be used to style the website, making the styling process faster and easier.
                        It is a framework where I write the css-classes directly in the HTML file. 
                        Though it sounds like it could lead to a messy HTML file, it is actually a very good tool to maintain a consistent look and feel across the website.
                        One of the best features is that I like in vanilla CSS can make my own classes combining the prebuilt classes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Installing tailwind is easy. I just have to run the command:<br /> <i>npm install tailwindcss</i><br /> and then I have to create a tailwind.config.js file.
                        In the tailwind.config.js file I can specify the settings for the tailwind framework like fonts and colors I want to make standard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        Tailwind takes the utility classes and converts them to css-classes in the output.css file. As in vanilla CSS, the output.css also needs to be linked to the HTML file.
                        So it has an input.css where I can write reusable utility classes and an output.css where the classes are converted to css-classes.

                                @apply self-center px-4 py-2 bg-stone-500 hover:bg-stone-600 rounded-lg font-semibold; <br />
                            }</i>
