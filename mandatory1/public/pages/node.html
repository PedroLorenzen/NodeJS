                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Node.js is an cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that gives me the opportunity to execute JavaScript code outside of a web
                        browser. It is suitable for building a wide range of server-side applications and tools like API's and databases and servers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Node.js comes with a ecosystem of modules and packages, managed through the Node Package Manager (npm). This simplifies
                        adding functionalities and managing dependencies in Node.js applications and allows me to use a vast array of
                        open-source libraries. These libraries are already developed and maintained functionalities so that I can use them instead of me writing and maintaining the code myself. <br />
                        To be able to install and use node and its packages I need to have a package.json file,
                        where I can specify any eventual packages and dependencies that has been or needs to be installed in the projet together with other valuable info to node like scripts.

                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        Node.js's use of JavaScript on both the client and server side gives me the opportunityto development of isomorphic single-page applications,
                        enabling code reuse and streamlining the development workflow. This also means that I only need to be good at coding in
                        JavaScript to work across the entire stack.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Express.js, often simply called Express, is a minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework,
                        that provides a set of features to develop web and mobile applications. Express simplifies the server creation process.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        The minimalist approach does not lock developers into a specific way of doing things, offering the freedom to use any
                        database and templating engine, and to structure the application as they see fit. This flexibility, however, requires
                        me to make more decisions about my application architecture and third-party libraries, potentially leading to a higher
                        complexity in larger applications.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        The framework is widely used meaning a wealth of plugins, middleware, and tutorials are
                        readily available, making it easier to add features or solve common problems.

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        In Node.js with Express, initializing an app starts with <br />
                        <i>import express from 'express'; <br /> </i>
                        <i>const app = express(); <br /> </i>
                        This is to set up the server. Using <i>app.listen(port);</i> launches the server, while <i>app.get('/')</i> and <i>app.post('/')</i> manage web
                        requests.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        An example of an endpoint I am using for this project looks like this:
                        <i>router.get('/about', (req, res) => {<br /> </i>
                        <i>    res.send(aboutPage)<br /></i>
                        <i>})</i>

                    <p class="infoParagraph">
                        Through the terminal, I can interact with Node.js, executing scripts, managing packages with npm (Node Package Manager),
                        and starting or managing server processes. This command-line interface (CLI) access is a fundamental part of Node.js,
                        and gives me a direct way to run JavaScript files, install third-party modules, and manage project dependencies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="infoParagraphBottom">
                        I have inserted a picture to the left of the most standard node terminal commands. <br />
                        <i>--save-dev</i> and <i>--save</i> are called flags. They specify the type of dependency I am installing. <br />
                        <i>--save-dev</i> is used to install a package that is only used during development, while <i>--save</i> 
                        is used to install a package that is used in production. <br />
                        One of the most common commands I use is <i>nodemon app.js</i> to start the server. 
                        Nodemon is a package that automatically restarts the server when I make changes to the code. <br /> 
                         <i>npm install</i> is used install node together with all the dependencies specified in the package.json file or 
                         <i>npm install package-name</i> to install a specific package.
